# Would You Rather Project

This is a simple web app of a Would you rather game, where by signing in you can answer questions as well as add new questions, check the leaderboard for your standing.

### How does it work

In your terminal npm install then npm start, then enjoy ;)

### Users

You have three users to choose from and login with.

### Pages

You can navigate through different pages using the navigation bar in the app, sign out and sign in with a different user, but if you used an unsupported page you will get 404 error.
